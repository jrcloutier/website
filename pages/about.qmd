I am Jimmy Cloutier (JIM-EE KL-oo-tyeh), a data and investigative journalist at the [Pittsburgh Post-Gazette](https://www.post-gazette.com/). That's a fancy way of saying I get paid to sift through large datasets and records to find and tell stories in the public interest. 

Before I joined the Post-Gazette, I covered campaign finance and lobbying for [OpenSecrets](https://www.opensecrets.org/), a nonprofit that tracks the influence of money in U.S. politics.I also freelanced for the [Virginia Center for Investigative Journalism](https://vcij.org/). 

I studied English literature at Virginia Commonwealth University and later graduated with a master's degree in investigative journalism from Arizona State University. Between then, I taught high school and spent two years in Armenia with the U.S. Peace Corps, teaching English as a foreign language. 

I grew up outside Richmond, Virginia, but I was born in a small town in Québec, Canada.
