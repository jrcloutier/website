I'm Jimmy Cloutier, a data and investigative journalist at the [Pittsburgh Post-Gazette](https://www.post-gazette.com/). I dig into large datasets and public records — often with code — to uncover stories that matter to the public.

Before joining the Post-Gazette, I covered campaign finance and lobbying for [OpenSecrets](https://www.opensecrets.org/), a nonprofit that tracks the influence of money in U.S. politics. I also freelanced for the [Virginia Center for Investigative Journalism](https://vcij.org/).

I studied English literature at Virginia Commonwealth University and earned a master’s in investigative journalism from Arizona State University. Along the way, I taught high school and spent two years in Armenia with the U.S. Peace Corps, teaching English as a foreign language.

I was born in Québec, Canada, but I grew up 1,000 miles south outside of Richmond, Va. <br><br> <a href="mailto:jcloutier@post-gazette" class="contact-button">{{< fa envelope >}} Email</a> <a href="https://signal.me/#eu/mfRohdbtUfQcObyk9dwMWhF_hWJFpQlaN2D-EIyG_vz30vghVJNBF7vozqmyjfhw" class="contact-button">{{< fa lock >}}  jrcloutier.92</a> <br><br> <br><br>
