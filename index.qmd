::: {#hero-heading}
I am a data and investigative journalist, which is a fancy way of saying I get paid to sift through large datasets and records to find and tell stories in the public interest. I currently report for the [Pittsburgh Post-Gazette](https://www.post-gazette.com/), where I have covered a range of issues including politics, housing, and coal mining. Before I joined the Post-Gazette, I covered campaign finance and lobbying for [OpenSecrets](https://www.opensecrets.org/), a nonprofit that tracks the influence of money in U.S. politics.
